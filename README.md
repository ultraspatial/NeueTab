NeueTab
</h1>
**Note: I will not be continuing development of this project, as difficulties with hosting and Zen Browser disabling the new tab has led me to stop using this.**
NeueTab is a start-page for Firefox, inspired by Neofetch and other command-line applications. It is currently a work-in-progress, with more features planned for the future.
## Features
- Date and Time
- Search Bar
- Shortcuts
- Looks like Neofetch if you squint really hard. Promise.
## Installation
### Option 1: Live Preview
A [live preview](https://pikobyte-exe.github.io/NeueTab/code/) of NeueTab is hosted on Github. This is how I use it.
### Option 2: Fork This Repo
You can fork this repo and host your own live preview with Github Pages.
### Option 3: Self-Hosting
You can clone this repo and self-host the website on your computer. Early in the making of this project, I used to use XAMPP to host this locally on my computer, due to limitations with New Tab Override. Only do this if you hate yourself.
### Note
You may need to use a third-party application, such as [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/), to override the default new tab of your browser.
